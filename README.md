# Referral SaaSquatch Android SDK

The Referral SaaSquatch Android SDK integrates a referral program into your Android app. Our mobile SDK has been designed to be part of a hybrid mobile device implementation. Client-side SDK elements are used in conjunction with server-side REST API functionality for the most complete, and secure, solution.

With our SDK you can register your users with Referral SaaSquatch, track users referrals, and fetch users information such as referral codes, share links, and rewards. For more information about our iOS SDK please visit our [Android SDK Overview](https://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/mobile/android/).
